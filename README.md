1)KNN: 
The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.
2)Clustering:
Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique designed to group unlabeled examples based on their similarity to each other.
3)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a data analysis approach that helps identify patterns in data sets to understand their main characteristics. EDA is often used as a first step in data analysis, and can help identify outliers and unexpected features in the data.

Project Output:
•	Perform data pre-processing operations.
•	As a part of data analysis and visualizations draw all the possible plots to provide essential informations and to derive some meaningful insights.
•	Show your correlation matrix of features according to the datasets.
•	Find out and plot different clusters according to different parameters like playlist genres , playlist names.
•	Build your model and show your final result so that the recommendation system can be built  based on that.
